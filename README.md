# Double Trouble: Gender Wage Gap and Stigma in Shaping Female Employment in India

This repo contains the code for my department field paper where I quantify the role of stigma against the gender wage gap in explaining the absence of (married) women from the workforce. The setup is simple: a household is characterized by a man and a woman. Each of them are endowed with some productivity in the home and the market. The man can be of two types: he may or may not want his wife to work. In case he doesn't, then the wife's market work imposes a stigma cost on the household.
